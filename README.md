# mssearchr

The primary goal of the `mssearchr` package is to enhance the capabilities of R
users for conducting library searches against electron ionization mass spectral
databases.

The `mssearchr` package offers the following tools:
- custom implementation of the Identity (EI Normal) algorithm;
- custom implementation of the Similarity (EI Simple) algorithm;
- library search via NIST API (i.e., by calling the *nistms$.exe* file);
- reading/writing *msp* files.
